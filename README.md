# GatorLibrary

**Steps to Execute the Code:**

* Place the input files in the project root folder
* Execute the command `python3 gatorLibrary.py <input_filename>.txt`
* An output file with name `<input_filename>_output_file.txt` is generated with the required output.

**Assumptions made while reading the input file:**
* Each line in the file corresponds to a single valid operation(provided in project description) on red-black tree
* `;` is not expected at end of an operation in any line since python function call does not end with a `;`
* Although all the lines from the file are read, execution of operations is performed until Quit() is executed or last operation is executed.


Input filename is expected in the format `<file_name>.txt`

Output filename would be `<file_name>_output_file.txt`
